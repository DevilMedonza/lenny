# laddy
An ldap client written in Electron

## Why a new app?
There is simply no good tool available to display ldap trees and filter them. Either the applications are too complicated or provide too little functionality. 

## What makes Laddy better than other apps?
* provide a simple user interface
* help users with the ldap syntax which is often not understood right (eg. a bindDN is basically the same as a username)
